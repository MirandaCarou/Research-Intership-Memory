This repository contains the Final Master‚Äôs Thesis (TFM) work on using three-level quantum systems (qutrits) to simulate phenomena in high-energy physics. In particular, **neutrino oscillations** are genuine quantum effects that can be efficiently studied via quantum simulation. Qutrits are especially well-suited for modeling three-flavor neutrino systems.

This project explores novel quantum circuits and machine learning models (autoencoders, GANs) that leverage qutrits to improve high-energy physics computations. It was conducted under a research grant titled ‚ÄúQutrit implementation to High Energy Physics improvement‚Äù and culminated in a Master‚Äôs thesis.
